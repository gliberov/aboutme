                    My name is Gabriel Liberov and I am a sophomore at Staten Island Technical High School. I am currently involved in the Science Engineering Research Program (SERP), Science Olympiad, and the SeaPerch Underwater Robotics Team. I also offer my volunteering services in the Tech Support Front Desk of our school as well as the Summer Design Institute (SDI) in the months of July and August. In our SERP group, we are currently researching the ability of bacterial strand Dechloromonas aromatica, to degrade mycelium Lentinus squarrosulus, in search for a more sustainable method of bioremediation. We are working with our mentor, Dr. John Coates of U.C Berkeley, who offers his expertise in microbiological applications in environmental sustainability, to bring our proposal into reality (you will find our full research proposal below in the portfolio). Outside of my interests in eco-friendly technologies, I have experience in Arduino-run TETRIX robotics as well as web-development based in JavaScript in various frameworks & libraries. In my freshman course of Intro to STEM & Robotics, my partner and I were the only ones of our year to achieve MASTERY on the final project (run recorded by Mr. Henriques found in portfolio below). Additionally, using the skills I learned during the year, I played around with Arduino during SDI to build new robots for the purpose of sumo-wrestling one another. At the end of our program, me and my fellow designers faced off against one another in the Sumo competition, which I won (slides showcasing progress found in portfolio below). In my web design endeavors, I have learned libraries such as D3.js for data visualization and complex graphing on top of the curriculum taught by Mr. Whalen in AP Computer Science Principles. In the project showcased below, titled “Rozinrov Enterprises”, I built a Firebase authenticated brokerage website, where one is able to register and sign-in for purposes of purchasing and selling stocks/equities. All of the data is extracted from an API online to produce real-time price changes, with time-sheets actively changing each time a user refreshes the graphs. The data is visualized using the library Charts.js merged with the framework Vue.js to display historical graphs as well as portfolio illustrations, making the user interface far more accessible for beginners in stock trading and helping them understand how each decision made on the website impacts their account. Being an Advanced Computer Applications candidate for next year’s roster, I enjoy learning new skills in the realm of coding everyday, and I am always looking for opportunities to enhance my current ones as well. An additional challenge I took up for the last two months was to learn how to code Java in the context of game dev (I was bored), which you will see Connect 4 coded in the language, one of the several projects I made, down below in this portfolio. I hope the accomplishments I have listed above reflect the contributions I could potentially bring to the FTC Robotics Team. (Portfolio is on the doc btw and there was absolute no reason to make this site)
